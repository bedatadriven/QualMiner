# Data preparation {-}

This section gives some ideas how the raw data of Ecuador monitoring looks like. 

* The data has been
extracted from *ActivityInfo* by using the *ActivityInfo API* and pre-processed
to make it ready for the analysis. 

* The most of data extraction and cleaning are
done beforehand (please see `R/` folder in the repository especially take a
close look at `etl.R` and `etl-methods.R` files). If you want to download the
raw data, you must have an access for it, that can be done by sourcing the
`etl.R` file.

* Data dictionary shows what the columns mean in the data:
  
  + `databaseId`: the internal ActivityInfo id for databases
    
  + `databaseName`: the name of databases visible to users
  
  + `folderId`: the internal ActivityInfo id for folders
  
  + `folderName`: the name of folders visible to users
  
  + `formId`: the internal ActivityInfo id for forms
  
  + `formName`: the name of forms visible to users
  
  + `subFormId`: the internal ActivityInfo id for the sub-forms where the records are kept
  
  + `subFormName`: the name of the sub-forms visible to users
  
  + `Month`: indicating month when a record is entered
  
  + `code`: Schema question code
  
  + `question`: Question label indicated by the code
  
  + `response`: Response given by users
  
  + `required`: A boolean value to check whether the question is required to complete.
  
  + `type`: internal type for the code. The available types in the data are 
  `r unique(form.table$type)`.
  
  + `partnerName`: The name of reporting partners. The name of implementing
  partners can be extracted from the data.
  
  + `canton`: The canton name of the record.
