# Sentiment analysis {-}

Sentiment analysis (also called as opinion mining) is a technique to understand
the emotional meanings of text given by a dictionary describing the
positive/negative words that already done by humans.

The responses seem to be written with a formal tone of voice; therefore, the
responses may not show any sentiment at all.

First, we find a sentiment lexicon for the Spanish language 
(source [here](https://sites.google.com/site/datascienceslab/projects/multilingualsentiment)).

```{r}
sentiments <- get_es_sentiments()
```

A wordcloud showing positive and negative words in the responses:
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
response.tokens %>%
  inner_join(sentiments, by = c("word_stem" = "word")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  reshape2::acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  wordcloud::comparison.cloud(
    colors = c("#FF6961", "#228FCF"),
    max.words = 100,
    title.colors = "#5c5c5c"
  )
```
