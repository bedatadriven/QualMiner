# Recode table {-#recode-table}

#### <i>Shorten sector names</i> {-}

Since the sector names in the database are quite long, we perform some recoding
by shortening them into a length of maximum one or two words.

Shortened sector names make tables and plots used in the analysis better because
they will not be disarrayed due to the unequal lengths of the long names.

The table below is referred as **recode table** across this documentation. 
It can be consulted here whenever it is needed.
