# Recode table {-#recode-table}

#### <i>Shorten sector names</i> {-}

Since the sector names in the database are quite long, we first perform some recoding
by shortening them into a length which equals to one or two words at maximum.

Shortened sector names make tables and plots used in the analysis look better as
they do not get disarrayed due to the unequal lengths of the long sector names.

The table below is referred as **recode table** across this documentation. 
The table can be consulted here whenever it is needed.
