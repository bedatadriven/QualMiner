In that section, we take text as data.

## Textual data processing

Perform stemming, which you bring nouns/verbs back to infinitive forms, and tokenization, which is separating words in meaningful pieces.

Remove noise in the text. There are usually a list of such words for each language and they are called as stop-words as they are overly distributed in the text and they will not give so meaningful results itself. Stop-words are including articles (*el/la*), conjunctions (*y*), pronouns (*yo/t√∫/etc.*) and so on.
