Exploring qualitative indicators via text mining methods.

This repository contains the source code. The data used in the analysis
can only be accessed by using
[*ActivityInfo*](https://www.activityinfo.org/) with proper permissions.

### Usage

The website is generated by using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).
Here are the common steps to generate the analysis are explained below.
For more detailed information about how bookdown works, it is advised to
take a look at the (online) book.

*Yihui Xie (2019). bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents
with R Markdown. Chapman and Hall/CRC. ISBN 978-1138700109*
<https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/>

#### 0\. Authenticate

The call below authenticates the current user for the requests to get
the data from *ActivityInfo*. See [**Notes**](#notes) section for more
details.

``` r
activityinfo::activityInfoLogin()
```

#### 1\. Retrieve data & ETL

Source `etl.R` file in the `R/` directory to pull the data from
*ActivityInfo API* and process it to make it ready for analyses. At the
end of the pull, a JSON file containing the data will be saved in the
`data/` directory.

#### 2\. Add new sections to notebook

Render [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files are placed in
the `analysis/` directory.

For instance, you create a new file called, e.g.
`analysis/new-section.Rmd`.

Then, add this new file name to the `analysis/_bookdown.yml` inside the
`rmd_files` array. The place where you add the path in the array is
important because the array orders the sections of the notebook.

#### 3\. Render notebook

Call this command in *R* console in order to render the bookdown site:

``` r
source("R/render.R"); render_bookdown()
```

Rendering does not require any connection with the *ActivityInfo API*
but the JSON data file must exist in the `data/` directory.

You will see in the git status that there are a bunch of new files
created inside the `docs/` folder because the rendered site is set to
live in the `docs/` folder in GitHub ([see
why](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages)).

#### 4\. Publish

Once you are happy with the changes in local, commit the rendered files
in the `docs/` folder and push them to the remote. You can use the
following command in your shell:

``` bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "Render site"
git push origin master
```

### Technical notes

  - The data can be accessed with *ActivityInfo* API by using user
    credentials. The [**ActivityInfo R Language
    Client**](https://github.com/bedatadriven/activityinfo-R) provides
    good documentation.

  - [**dplyr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) package is
    chosen as it is useful for rapid ad-hoc analyses. The selected
    analysis code can be rewritten in base R, which is proven to be more
    robust and stable for production environments, towards the end of
    the project.
