# Recode table {-#recode-table}

We shorten the form topic names by *recoding* them because they
appear to be long and disarray the plots. The *recode table* below presents a
lookup table for the form labels.

```{r recode-table}
recode_tbl %>% 
  group_by(folderName) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  gt_condensed_style() %>% 
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = md("*Some short form names (e.g. 'Salud') stay as such, no need to make them even shorter*"),
    locations = cells_column_labels(
      columns = vars(formNameRecode)
    )
  )
```
