# Response quality {-}

*Response quality* is a term that means how much response the questions receive. The idea is to
find cases that affect the response quality to understand if they work or
not under some conditions. In the end, the results may reveal some handful
insights about the quality of textual responses in the narrative fields.

Some questions to research *response quality* by measuring *word count* and
*sentence length*:

+ Is there any relationship between the word counts of response, question and
description fields?

+ What is the distribution between response word count and explanatory variables
such as the question, form topic, canton name, partner name, etc.

*Assumptions:*

+ Responses with a *larger word count* have more quality than the responses
with *smaller word count*.

In other words, we assume that *the more word the better is*. The limitations
are based on the unequal distribution of the data. The word count of responses
and questions can be related to other things, such as the questions require
short answers so then the responses tend to be shorter.

Additionally, we can have a cross-analysis to test these outcomes. It might be a
good idea to have a small subset of data and ask an expert to test the
assumptions qualitatively. For instance, we can take the first twenty responses
with the highest word count and the last twenty responses with the lowest word
count. We chose the extreme directions because they point out the greatest
differences which are easier to test assumptions.
