Box plots are used to visualize the *measure of spread* showing the variability
and dispersion of the data.

In the boxplot above, we see a number of things:

1) each individual black point in a group represents a "response" in the
records, and it position indicates the value of word count;

2) left and right borders of the central rectangle (colored red) presents the
first and third quartile values of IQR respectively;

3) the line in the middle of the rectangle indicates the *median* value;

4) the end of the lines streched from both right and left sides of the central
rectangle point the maximum and minimum values;

5) the orange colored points show the *outliers*.
