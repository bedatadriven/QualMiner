Exploring qualitative indicators via text mining methods.

### Main steps

```
{a graph}
```

### Notes

+ The data can be accessed with *ActivityInfo* API by using user credentials.
See 
[**ActivityInfo R Language Client**](https://github.com/bedatadriven/activityinfo-R)
for more details.

+ [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) package is chosen as it is
useful for rapid ad-hoc analyses. The selected analysis code can be rewritten in
base R, which is proven to be more robust and stable for production
environments, towards the end of the project.
